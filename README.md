## Code implementation:  
[BDA_SurveyAnalysis.ipynb](https://github.com/Matrasulov/BDA_Final/blob/main/BDA_SurveyAnalysis.ipynb)

I made a dataset by inputting the survey results using one of the Language Models like OpenAI's **ChatGPT**. **But**, it didn't produce the full dataset, so I manually entered the survey answers of the last 10 participants.

**Python libraries used in code implementation**:
To analyze the selection method using Python and plot a graph, you can use libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib or Seaborn for plotting.
```
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```
